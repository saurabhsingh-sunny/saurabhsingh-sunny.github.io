### A Decade of Technical Leadership
My career has evolved from building foundational enterprise solutions to architecting global BI strategies. This breadth allows me to approach data not just as an analyst, but as a **Solution Architect**.

### Professional Milestones
* **Strategic Growth:** Transitioned from a **Solution Architect role at HCL** to a Lead Analyst role at Bayer, moving from infrastructure management to strategic data utilization.
* **Academic Rigor:** My **MS in Information Systems** from Marist University provided the technical springboard into Advanced Analytics, including specialized work in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
* **Technical Authority:** I currently serve as the Data Insight & BI Strategy Lead for the SPI organization at Bayer, overseeing the data roadmap for 200+ stakeholders.

### Career Philosophy
I believe that data is only as valuable as the decisions it enables. My role is to ensure that technical architecture and analytical rigor are perfectly aligned with business goals.
