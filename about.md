My journey in data science began with a fascination for how variables in the field 
translate to numbers on a screen. With an MS in Business Analytics (3.98 GPA) 
and a background in Agronomy from Purdue, I've spent a decade ensuring that 
"data-driven" isn't just a buzzword, but a measurable impact (like the 20% 
reduction in COGS I led at Bayer).
