With over 12 years of experience in AgTech and Data Science, I bridge the gap between complex biological data and business ROI. 

Currently, as the BI Strategy Lead at Bayer, I oversee data strategy for a 200+ member organization. My focus is on scaling data insights and driving operational efficiency through statistical modeling and modern BI tools.
