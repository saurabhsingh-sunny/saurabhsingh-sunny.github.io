## Hey, I'm happy you're here.

Thanks for stopping by!

I work as a **BI Strategy Lead** bridging the gap between technical data engineering and executive decision-making.

My research interests include **Causal Inference**, **Data Governance**, and the **Psychology of Decision Making**.

### Core Philosophy

> "The role of a data professional is not just to report what happened, but to scientifically determine why it happened."

I created this **Decision Science Lab** to document my transition from traditional BI to advanced Computational Logic. It serves as a living library of my professional blueprints and a sandbox for my Python experiments.

Prior to this lab, I developed novel data mining methods to extract meaningful information from disparate data sources. 

I am particularly interested in research that combines business strategy with computational rigor.
