## The Professional Profile

I am a **Senior Data Analyst** & **BI Lead** with over 12 years of experience.

My focus is on the practical application of data strategy. I don't claim to be a Cloud Architect; I am a strategist who builds reliable reporting engines.

### Core Competencies

* **Engineering:** Building reliable data pipelines and governance models (SQL/BigQuery).
* **Intelligence:** Designing executive dashboards that drive action (Tableau/Power BI).
* **Analysis:** Applying statistical rigor to business ambiguity.

## Technical Proficiency

| **Statistical Analysis** | ⭐⭐⭐ (Intermediate) | Hypothesis Testing |
| **Cloud / ML** | ⭐ (Learning) | Python, Cloud Architecture |

## The Goal

I created this site to document my transition from **Business Intelligence** to **Decision Science**. It serves as a living library of my case studies and a sandbox for my learning journey in Python and Statistics.
