### Saurabh Singh
**Senior Data Analyst & BI Lead**
*Bridging the gap between Reporting & Science.*

## The Professional Profile

I am a **BI Strategy Lead** with over 12 years of experience architecting data solutions.

My expertise lies in the "Full Stack" of decision making:
1.  **Engineering:** Building reliable data pipelines and governance models (SQL/BigQuery).
2.  **Intelligence:** Designing executive dashboards that drive action (Tableau/Power BI).
3.  **Science:** Applying statistical rigor to business ambiguity (Python/Inference).

### The Philosophy
I founded this "Lab" to document the intersection of **Business Strategy** and **Computational Logic**. 

In my view, the role of a data professional is not just to report *what* happened, but to scientifically determine *why* it happened and *what* to do next.
