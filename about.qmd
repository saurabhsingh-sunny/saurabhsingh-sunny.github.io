## From Engineering Rigor to Decision Logic.

I have always been obsessed with how complex systems work. 

My journey didn't start in a notebook; it started in a server room, managing the infrastructure for **1,500+ servers**. That experience wired me with an "Engineering First" mindset: data pipelines shouldn't just run; they should be robust, scalable, and bulletproof.

Over the last **12 years**, I evolved from keeping the lights on to illuminating the path forward. I realized that a beautiful dashboard is useless if the underlying logic is flawed.

Today, I define myself as a **Decision Scientist**. I use my background in **Electrical Engineering** and **Mathematics** to bring statistical rigor to Business Intelligence. I don't just report *what* happened; I build **Linear Mixed Models** and **Causal Inference** frameworks to mathematically prove *why* it happened.

### Core Philosophy

> "Intuition is a great starting point, but a terrible finishing line. We owe it to our stakeholders to back our strategy with mathematical certainty."

### The Professional Arc

I currently lead data initiatives within the **Computational Sciences Team** at Bayer. My role is to bridge the gap between technical complexity and executive strategy.

I specialize in **"Metric Anatomy"**—deconstructing high-level KPIs into their statistical components to reveal hidden risks. Whether it is migrating an entire ecosystem from Tableau to Power BI or modeling **Emergence Risk**, my goal is always the same: **Precision**.

* **Toolkit:** Python, R, SQL, Linear Mixed Models
* **Focus:** Data Governance, Architecture, Strategic BI

### Offline

When I am not calculating p-values or optimizing data pipelines, I try to disconnect (though I admit, I still read a lot of non-fiction).

I am a huge **Cricket** fan—both playing and watching. Recently, I’ve been trying to translate my hand-eye coordination to **Tennis** and **Pickleball**, mostly as a way to share a fun activity with my wife (and get some cardio in).

Spending time with family keeps me grounded and reminds me that not every decision needs a data model.
