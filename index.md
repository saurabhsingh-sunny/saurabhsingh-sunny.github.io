# Bridging Agronomy and Analytics

I am a data leader with 12 years of experience at the intersection of agriculture and technology. My work centers on transforming complex biological datasets into high-stakes business strategy.

### Strategic Leadership at Bayer
Currently, I lead the **Business Intelligence Strategy** for the SPI organization at Bayer Crop Science. I specialize in building data products that quantify ROI, specifically focusing on statistical modeling that drives over **$5M in annual business value**.

### Domain Expertise
With an **MS in Business Analytics (3.98 GPA)** and a background in **Agronomy (Purdue)**, I bridge the gap between field science and the executive suite.
