# Sr. Data Analyst | Data Insight & Business Intelligence Strategy Lead

I am a technical leader with 12 years of experience at the intersection of data architecture and strategic insights. With a foundation spanning massive infrastructure environments to advanced agricultural research data, I specialize in navigating the transition from raw data chaos to governed, high-trust analytical ecosystems enabling data driven decision making. 

### 📈 Proven Technical Impact
* **Relationship & Discovery:** I build the partnerships necessary to identify organizational friction before any code is written.
* **Process & Architecture:** I consult on data definitions and improve the processes used to capture, collect, and transform data at the source.
* **Reliable Insights:** I turn raw, fragmented datasets into visual stories and statistical models that enable confident business actions.
* **Mentorship:** I am passionate about training junior analysts in the craft of data discovery and helping non-tech leaders interpret complex data with ease.

### 💻 Technical Core
I architect domain-agnostic solutions using a modern data stack:
* **Advanced Analytics:** Statistical modeling and predictive analytics using Python (Pandas/Scikit-learn) and SQL.
* **Data Engineering:** Designing scalable ETL pipelines and cloud-based schemas in Google BigQuery/GCP.
* **Data Visualization:** Sharing Data Insights through reports and dashboards in Tableau, Power BI and TIBCO Spotfire.
* **Strategy:** Leading technical roadmaps and ensuring "Single Source of Truth" integrity for global organizations.

### 🧬 Current Research Focus
* **Work:** I am currently investigating ways to quantify **Time-to-Insight (TTI)** by measuring the impact of data friction on research velocity, while exploring the use of **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** to diagnose quality gaps in media-rich datasets.

* **Self:**I am currently applying Python-based statistical modeling to investigate the **CMS Sterility Yield Penalty** using the G2F (Genomes to Fields) dataset with advanced computational methodologies.
