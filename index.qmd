## Architecting Decision Logic for High-Variance Environments

Welcome to the **Decision Science Lab**.

In modern enterprise, data is abundant but *certainty* is scarce. This Lab documents my work in bridging that gap.

I specialize in **deconstructing complex systems**—where variables are noisy and causality is hidden—and **architecting the decision frameworks** needed to solve them reliably.

### Core Research Pillars

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🏛️ Architecture** | Designing cost-efficient, tiered data lineages that scale. |
| **🧠 Logic** | Defining the mathematical frameworks for business success. |
| **🧪 Science** | Applying Causal Inference to non-randomized, messy datasets. |
