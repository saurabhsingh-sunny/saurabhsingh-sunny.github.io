## Core Competencies

::: {.panel-tabset}

## 📊 Data Storytelling

**The Interface Layer.**

Designing executive dashboards is not just about charts; it's about **Metric Design**. My work focuses on translating complex ambiguity into clear, actionable KPIs using Tableau and Power BI.

* **Key Tech:** Tableau, Power BI, Streamlit
* **Focus:** KPI Trees, Executive Cockpits

## ⚙️ System Architecture

**The Engine Room.**

Reliable science requires reliable data. I architect tiered storage systems (Bronze/Silver/Gold) and governed lineages to ensure that the numbers we report are the numbers that exist.

* **Key Tech:** SQL (BigQuery), dbt, Airflow
* **Focus:** Dimensional Modeling, Cost Optimization

## 🧠 Decision Science

**The Laboratory.**

Moving beyond "What happened?" to "Why did it happen?" and "What will happen?". This is my active research zone for applying statistical rigor to business problems.

* **Key Tech:** Python (Scikit-Learn), CausalImpact
* **Focus:** Propensity Modeling, A/B Testing, Inference
