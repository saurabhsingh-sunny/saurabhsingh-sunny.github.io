That experience wired me with an “Engineering First” mindset: data pipelines shouldn’t just run; they should be robust, scalable, and bulletproof.\nOver the last 12 years, I evolved from keeping the lights on to illuminating the path forward. I realized that a beautiful dashboard is useless if the underlying logic is flawed.\nToday, I define myself as a Decision Scientist. I use my background in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics to bring statistical rigor to Business Intelligence. I don’t just report what happened; I build Linear Mixed Models and Causal Inference frameworks to mathematically prove why it happened.\n\n\n\n“Intuition is a great starting point, but a terrible finishing line. We owe it to our stakeholders to back our strategy with mathematical certainty.”"
