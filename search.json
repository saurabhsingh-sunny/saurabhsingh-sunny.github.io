    "text": "The Professional Profile\nI am a BI Strategy Lead with over 12 years of experience architecting data solutions.\nMy expertise lies in the “Full Stack” of decision making: 1. Engineering: Building reliable data pipelines and governance models (SQL/BigQuery). 2. Intelligence: Designing executive dashboards that drive action (Tableau/Power BI). 3. Science: Applying statistical rigor to business ambiguity (Python/Inference).\n\nThe Philosophy\nI founded this “Lab” to document the intersection of Business Strategy and Computational Logic.\nIn my view, the role of a data professional is not just to report what happened, but to scientifically determine why it happened and what to do next."
